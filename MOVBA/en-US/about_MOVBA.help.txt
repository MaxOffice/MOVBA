SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A PowerShell module to manage VBA macro libraries.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    In the context of this project, a VBA macro _library_ is a collection of useful
    functionality implemented using VBA macros. A single library contains macros 
    for one Microsoft Office application only. 

    Within a library, macros are further arranged into _packages_. Each package 
    implements a particular functionality. A package can expose its functionality 
    via functions that can be called from other macros, or via an interactive 
    user interface.

    Packages in a library can be combined to form a Microsoft Office document or 
    add-in. Users can choose all packages, or selective packages, when they build 
    a document or add-in from the library.
