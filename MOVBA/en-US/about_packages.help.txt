SHORT DESCRIPTION
    MOVBA packages contain VBA modules, class modules and/or Userforms.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    A package is a directory with the following structure:

    \<package name>
    |
    --Tests\
    |
    --CustomUI\
    |   |
    |   customUI.xml
    |
    <package VBA files..>

    A package must have a name that is unique in the library. Package names 
    are case-insensitive.

    The package directory contains VBA files, such as VBA Modules (.bas files), 
    VBA Class Modules (.cls files), and UserForms (.frm and .frx files). When a 
    document or an add-in is built from the library, and a package is included, 
    all these files are imported into the resulting document or add-in.

    The tests\ subdirectory should contain a document created using the 
    Microsoft Office application that is the target of the parent library. This
    document should have test cases for checking the functionality implemented 
    by the package.

    The CustomUI\ subdirectory contains a file called customUI14.xml, 
    written using the Microsoft Office RibbonX specification. When a document or
    an add-in is built from the library, and a package is included, its 
    customUI14.xml file is merged with that of other packages and imported 
    into the resulting document or add-in.

    The Get-MVPackage, New-MVPackage and Remove-MVPackage cmdlets in this 
    module are used to manage packages.
