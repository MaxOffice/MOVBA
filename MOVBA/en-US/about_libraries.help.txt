SHORT DESCRIPTION
    MOVBA libraries contain VBA macros for any one Microsoft Office application,
    divided into packages.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    A library is a directory with the following structure:

    \<library name>
    |
    --out\
    |
    --packages\
    |
    library.json

    The out\ subdirectory contains add-ins or documents created by combining 
    packages in the library.

    The packages\ subdirectory contains packages.

    The library.json file contains metadata about the library, including the 
    name of the library and the Microsoft Office application which hosts all 
    macros contained in the library.

    The Get-MVLibrary, New-MVLibrary, Initialize-MVLibrary and Build-MVLibrary
    cmdlets in this module are used to manage libraries.
